# Initial Backlog Ideas
1. As a property manager, I want to schedule deep cleans after tenants move out so that the units are ready for new renters.
2. As a solo cleaner, I want to create a profile with my skills and availability so that clients can find and book me easily.
3. As a small cleaning business, I want to register multiple cleaners under my business so that I can manage bookings effectively.
4. As an elderly individual, I want to find a trusted and verified cleaner so that I feel safe having them in my home.
5. As an enterprise-level cleaning company, I want a dashboard to track multiple jobs and team assignments for large-scale operations
6. As a cleaning service provider, I want a dispute resolution system that includes a blacklist feature so that I can handle conflicts with customers professionally and avoid repeated bad experiences.
7. As an end user, I want to cancel or reschedule a booking with a clear policy so that I know the consequences of changes.
8. As a service provider, I want an earnings summary and payout history so that I can track my income over time.
9. As a busy homeowner, I want a reminder feature for upcoming cleanings so that I donâ€™t forget my appointments.
10. As a customer, I want to specify areas of focus (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, windows) so that the cleaner knows my priorities.

# Project planning BEFORE iteration-1, (see chapters 1-3)
Checklist/TODOs: 
* Update the following during each week prac session
* github entry timestamp is BEFORE the iteration-1
* User stories are correct: see p39
* Must have more user stories than fits into iterations 1 and 2. To practice the priority.

User Stories:
* [Account Creation](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 2 days 
* [Book cleaner](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 2 days 
* [Accept a booking](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 1 day 
* [User profile management](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 3 days 
* [Track job completion](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 30, 1 days 
* [Handling customer disputes](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 30, 2 days
* [Rescheduling bookings](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 20, 2 days 
* [Earnings and payment management](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 30, 3 days 
* [Bookings calendar](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 4 days 
* [User and cleaner communication](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 20, 2 days 
* [Rate a cleaner](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 1 day 
* [Create a cleaning checklist](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 20, 1 day 

**Total Estimated Days = 24 days**

Calculate the amount of work, in people days, that our team can handle per iteration:

- Each iteration is 4 calendar weeks. Assuming that we have other subjects, this gives only about 4 working days. 
- We have 4 group members
- The first pass velocity will be assumed to be 0.5, since we expect other unexpected work for other subjects that will have to be completed

Number of people x Number of working days x velocity = 4 x 4 x 0.5 = **8 actual people days per iteration**

Total milestone estimate = 8 x 2 = **16 actual people days for the milestone**

## Iteration 1 [duration 3-4 weeks], Start: 10/02/2025, End: 10/03/2025 

* Goal is to have 2 iterations during a trimester of teaching.
* Update the following during each week prac session
* During pracs, you may experiment with using other github ways of tracking changes, e.g. via pull requests.

* [Account Creation](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 2 days
* [Book cleaner](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 2 days
* [Accept a booking](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 1 day 
* [User profile management](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 3 days 

## Iteration 2 [duration 3-4 weeks], Start: 11/02/2025, End: 7/04/2025
Goal is to have 2 iterations during a trimester of teaching.

* [Track job completion](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 30, 1 days
* [Rescheduling bookings](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 20, 2 days
* [Bookings calendar](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 4 days
* [Rate a cleaner](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 10, 1 day

## Not enough time/developers:
* [Create a cleaning checklist](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 20, 1 day
* [User and cleaner communication](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md), priority 20, 2 days
* [Earnings and payment management](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 30, 3 days
* [Handling customer disputes](./user_stories/user_story_01_title.md) priority 30, 2 days

# Actual iterations
1. [Iteration-1](./iteration_1.md)
2. [Iteration-2](./iteration_2.md)

# New Velocity:
E1 = 8 days
A1 = 13 days
V1 = E1/A1
   = 8/13
   = 0.6154

E2 = 4 days (Ideal days)
V2 = 4/8 * 0.6154
   = 0.3077

Therefore, the new velocity is 0.3077

E1 = Number of user story days per person for iteration 1. Before we apply the velocity for iteration 1.
A1 = The actual number of days that we have 

Have list of user stories with estimates. Add them up to get total E1. TE1. Then we divide by number of people to get E1.
A1 is always less than estimated. A1 = E1 * v1. Apply velocity to E1 to get the actual number of dats.
Before the iteration: How many days does each person do per week? A1 *

 if each person has 2 days a week that they will work and we go for 4 weeks, then A1 per developer is equal to 2 * 4 = 8 days?
 8 * 0.7 = 5.6 ideal days we have. We can choose 5.6 days worth of user stories from the backlog.
 
E1 * v1 (0.7) = A1
