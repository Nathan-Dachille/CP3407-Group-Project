# Profiles
Each user will be able to view their profile.

## Priority: 20
This was assigned a priority of 20 before iteration 1.

## Estimation: 1 day
(Estimated ideal days before iteration 1)
* David: 1 day
* Bailey: 0.5 days
* Nathan: 0.5 day
* Quinn: 1 day

Actual days before iteration 1: 0.5 / 0.5 = 1 day

## Assumptions (if any):
A database table must be made for the profiles to be stored.

## Description:
Description-v1: A web page that will allow users to make a booking for a cleaner that is available in their area.

## Tasks:
* Create a booking page view (Customers can book cleans), 1 day
    - Customer can select day for clean on calendar, they may then be presented with a list of cleaners
    - It will lookup their area from their profile and compare to serviced area for cleaner
* Create a manager dashboard page view (Employer - Cleaners and their jobs/working hours), 2 days
* Create a cleaner dashboard page view (Cleaner - View upcoming jobs), 1 day
* Create a job model, 0.5 days

Total Task Estimate: 4 days
