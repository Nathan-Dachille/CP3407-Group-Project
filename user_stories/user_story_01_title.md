# Initial Backlog Ideas
1. As a property manager, I want to schedule deep cleans after tenants move out so that the units are ready for new renters.
2. As a solo cleaner, I want to create a profile with my skills and availability so that clients can find and book me easily.
3. As a small cleaning business, I want to register multiple cleaners under my business so that I can manage bookings effectively.
4. As an elderly individual, I want to find a trusted and verified cleaner so that I feel safe having them in my home.
5. As an enterprise-level cleaning company, I want a dashboard to track multiple jobs and team assignments for large-scale operations
6. As a cleaning service provider, I want a dispute resolution system that includes a blacklist feature so that I can handle conflicts with customers professionally and avoid repeated bad experiences.
7. As an end user, I want to cancel or reschedule a booking with a clear policy so that I know the consequences of changes.
8. As a service provider, I want an earnings summary and payout history so that I can track my income over time.
9. As a busy homeowner, I want a reminder feature for upcoming cleanings so that I donâ€™t forget my appointments.
10. As a customer, I want to specify areas of focus (e.g., kitchen, bathroom, windows) so that the cleaner knows my priorities.














# User story title: e.g. Show current deals

Keep any other version here as well, e.g. Display current deals, Let user to click on "show-current-deals".

## Priority: 10 (e.g. latest for iteration-1)
Any notes on priority go here. 
Note you may have different priorities at different stages of you project.
Again, keep all changes here for marking.

## Estimation: e.g. 2 days
Any notes on estimation go here. Keep your planning poker game numbers. For example
* Bob: 1 day (e.g. estimated before iteration-1)
* Lisa: 2 days
* Jack: 3 days

## Assumptions (if any):

## Description: e.g. The web page will show current deals to Orion's orbits users
You need to keep all versions here so that your instructor/marker can see your changes easily. 
In a real project, your older versions could be viewed via commits.

Description-v1: e.g. The web site will show current deals to Orion's orbits users

## Tasks, see chapter 4.

1. Task 1, Estimation XX days
2. ...
