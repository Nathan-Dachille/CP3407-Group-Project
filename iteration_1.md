### Burn Down for iteration-1 (see chapter 4):
Update this at least once per week

* 2 weeks left, 8 days
* 1 weeks left, 7.75 days
* 0 weeks left, 4.75 days
* Actual Velocity: 0.4

At this time in the project we had other subjects we were working on and 
were still finding our feet on this assignment. Hence, the low velocity. 
This velocity will be used to influence the iteration 2 backlog.
